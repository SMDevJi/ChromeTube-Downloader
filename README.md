## Important Notice on Legality
Using ChromeTube Downloader responsibly is essential. Downloading YouTube videos may violate YouTube's Terms of Service unless you have explicit permission from the content owner or are downloading content that falls under fair use. 

In 2020, GitHub reinstated youtube-dl after verifying that its use for legal purposes, such as archival and educational purposes, is allowed ([read more here](https://github.blog/news-insights/policy-news-and-insights/standing-up-for-developers-youtube-dl-is-back/)). ChromeTube Downloader follows the same principles—use it legally and responsibly.

### Allowed Use Cases:
- Downloading your own uploaded videos
- Downloading copyright-free or Creative Commons-licensed videos
- Educational, archival, or fair use purposes

### Prohibited Use Cases:
- Downloading copyrighted content without permission
- Redistributing copyrighted content

## Recommended Usage
To avoid issues with YouTube or Google accounts, it is advised to use ChromeTube Downloader on a separate browser profile or an entirely different browser. This minimizes the risk of account restrictions or other potential problems.
